Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

public class Solution {
    public string ReverseStr(string s, int k) {
        char[] a = s.ToCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i += k*2){
            int m = i, n = Math.Min(i + k - 1, a.Length - 1);
            while (m < n){
                char temp = a[m];
                a[m++] = a[n];
                a[n--] = temp;
            }
        }
        return new string(a);
    }
}
