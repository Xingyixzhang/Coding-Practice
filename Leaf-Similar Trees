Question --
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
Note: Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public bool LeafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        var leaf1 = new List<int>();
        var leaf2 = new List<int>();
        helper(root1, leaf1);
        helper(root2, leaf2);
        return leaf1.SequenceEqual(leaf2);
    }
    public void helper(TreeNode node, List<int> leaf){
        if (node == null)   return null;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) leaf.Add(node.val);
        helper(node.left, leaf);
        helper(node.right, leaf);
    }
}
